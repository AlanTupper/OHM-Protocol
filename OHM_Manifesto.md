# A Manifesto for an Open Hyperlinked Metaverse

The Open Metaverse is already here, but it is barely in its infancy. 
It is growing and evolving in fits and starts. 
As it grows, it is our shared responsibility to ensure that it grows into something greater than the sum of its parts and becomes an open, robust system. 
We must ensure that it empowers it’s users, positively affects the world at large, and remains open to further growth and evolution.  
To do this we will do our best to adhere to the following:

1. OHM is the Open Hyperlinked Metaverse. It transcends individual technologies and platforms to form a unified seamless virtual reality.
2. OHM is a collaborative experience engine. It exists to bring people together to work, play, think, and feel with one another.
3. OHM is ever changing and evolving. That which prevents it from doing so will be treated as damage and routed around.
4. OHM is voluntary, social, and emergent. It is larger than the sum of its parts through the free collaboration of its users.
5. OHM is the sole domain of no one party, but instead belongs to its contributors. The value of OHM comes from shared participation.
6. OHM is built upon shared rules and open standards which all may have a hand in shaping.
7. OHM exists to make the world a better place, one small unexpected change at a time.

Like all good protocols, this Manifesto may change over time to reflect reality as it’s encountered.
