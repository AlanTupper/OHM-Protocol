OHM-Protocol
============

A set of protocols for building the Open Hyperlinked Metaverse (OHM)

OHM is a open protocol stack for creating and sharing free-form, decentralized federated virtual worlds. It is built primarily on top of XMPP.

The goals of OHM are:

1. Create a robust, flexible protocol stack that can be used to create a large federated virtual world network
2. Focus on designs which increase individual freedom to share and express through federated virtual worlds
3. Deliver on the promise of a decentralized internet-scale Metaverse
4. Be generally excellent and not evil

Currently in early design phase, follow the process at http://ohmprotocol.wordpress.com
