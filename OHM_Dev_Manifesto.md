This is the manifesto that will be guiding the design and development processes for OHM. 

* Protocols come first.  Without protocols it’s just a walled garden with invisible walls.
* Use other people’s work when possible (and give them credit).
* Use ridiculously simple test cases. Simple test cases shake out the basic wrinkles before it’s complex.
* Ideological purism is no match for practicality.
* Yes you can design it yourself. No, it won’t be easy.
* When in doubt, share.
* Keep it simpler.

Like all good protocols, this Manifesto may change over time to reflect reality as it’s encountered.
